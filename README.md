# Prediction of electricity consumed in households 
## A model which is used to predict the electricity consumed based on various factors like humidity, temperature, windspeed etc..
### 1. I have developed a Machine Learning Model that predicts the electrical energy consumed in the households.
### 2. I have integrated the Machine Learning Model with the web development as to get an interface to my Machine Learning Model.
### 3. I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, SQLite3 to create the webpages.
### 4. I have also created a simple chatbot called Electro where it solves questions related to electrical energies.
### 5. I have also created a dashboard that explains the insights that I have found visually . So that the users can view and understand the insights more easily.
### 6. I used some references on web to find how to connect a exeternal python file to a webpage.
